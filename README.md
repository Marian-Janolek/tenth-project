## Responsive Headphones Website

- One of many of my pure HTML CSS and JAVASCRIPT projects. 
- It's landing page about headphones, which contains basic infrmation about product, price and list of products.
- In this project I have learned how to use many css properties like grid, flex, hover effects and responsive design.
- With help of Scroll Reveal script I was able to use some reavel animation on event scrolling.
